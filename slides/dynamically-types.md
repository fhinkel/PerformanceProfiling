##  Typing

In strongly types languages, you define the type of all variables, e.g., Java, C++. 
In dynamically typed languages, compiler/interpreter infers types by how you use the 
variables, e.g., PHP, JavaScript. 

```c
int a = "Hello world"; // nope
```

```js
var a = "hello;" 
a = 42;  // change the type as you like
```

If the compiler knows that type **ahead of time** it can make optimizations 
while compiling.
